# 👋 Hi, I’m George Georgopoulos

Welcome to **robincores**, the home for R8 architecture development, including the **R8** CPU family, its assembler, and various related projects! I'm passionate about building efficient and flexible CPUs from the ground up, inspired by classic designs like the **Transputer** and modern architectures like **RISC-V** and **JVM**. Here's what you can expect from my work:

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- **Stack-based CPU architectures** that simplify computation while offering flexibility.
- **Embedded systems**, **custom CPU cores**, and **performance optimization**.
- Pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with **open-source hardware**.

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Advanced CPU design principles to refine and expand the **R8 family**.
- Building a robust toolchain and ecosystem for the **R8 CPU family**.
- Bringing the **Skyline** home computer project to life, powered by the **R824 CPU**.

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- **Open-source CPU development**: If you're passionate about CPU design or emulator development, let’s build something great together!
- **Assembler tooling** for the R8 family.
- Projects that push the performance and capabilities of **embedded systems**.

## 📫 How to reach me:
Feel free to get in touch through GitHub discussions or issues on this repository. I'm always excited to chat about CPU architecture or get feedback on the **R8 project**!

## 😄 Pronouns:

## ⚡ Fun fact:
The **R8 family** began as a simple 8-bit CPU design but has since grown into a complete family of stack-based architectures designed for a wide range of applications—from small embedded systems to high-performance computing!

### About R8

The **R8 Family CPU** is a minimalist, stack-based CPU architecture designed for both flexibility and efficiency. Whether you're building embedded systems or exploring modern hardware designs, the R8 family offers a modular foundation. The **R824**, one of the family’s flagship models, brings the simplicity of stack-based computation to a modern, multi-bit register architecture, maintaining the flexibility required for both simple and complex systems.
